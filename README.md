# PyOCT for coherent imaging data processing

This is the repository of codes that have been implemented with my own experience in coherent imaging, including optical coherence tomography (OCT) and digital holography microscopy (DHM), data process as well as miscellaneous tools that I used for my daily practice. 

The codes are free to use for your own under the MIT license while if you want to publish any methods or algorithms that will be developed based on my codes, please make an inquiry in advance. 

The example dataset can be download from [OCT Example Dataset](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/EV2P3I).
